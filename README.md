# Telematum Appointment Management System

This is a simple appointment management system built using React. It fetches appointment data from an external API and displays it in a tabular format.

## Features

- Display appointments with patient details, appointment date, time, doctor, and injury information.
- Format appointment date in "DD-MMM-YYYY" format (e.g., 26-Feb-2024).
- Display appointment time with color indication (green for AM and red for PM) without "AM" or "PM" indicator.
- Use professional box shadow for styling.
